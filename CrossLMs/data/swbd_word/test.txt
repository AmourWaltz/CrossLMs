okay hi
hi um yeah i'd like to talk about how you dress for work and and um what do you normally what type of outfit do you normally have to wear
well i work in uh corporate control so we have to dress kind of nice so i usually wear skirts and sweaters in the winter time slacks i guess [noise] and in the summer just dresses
um-hum
we can't even well we're not even really supposed to wear jeans very often
so it really doesn't vary that much from season to season since the office is kind of you know always the same temperature
and is
right right is there is there um an- is there a like a code of dress where you work do they ask
so
[noise] not formally
right
but it's kind of understood that we're supposed to dress a little bit nice a lot of times we have to go over to uh like jerry junkins' office and bill ellsworth's office to deliver stuff
[noise] right
and we prepare a lot of foils for marvin and bill so [noise] we have to dress a little bit nice we're not [noise]
right right and does it does it change i guess um you can can you judge like [noise] depending on what you think you'll be doing that day
yes now you know if if every- like in august when everybody's on vacation or something we can dress a little more casual or
right
ice storms of course you know we all came in in our tennis shoes but [laughter] i guess that would have to do with the weather but um
yes [laughter]
yeah yeah well i- i- that's right and it
unless it's an ex- you know an unusual day
yeah and it was usually uh also uh where i was it was um i- in engineering and and it was it was a casual office there was no formal dress code but [noise]
um-hum
um uh usually engineers are expected to to dress you know little more professionally it just in case things would come up during the day sometimes unexpected meetings or a client would come in and wanna see you [noise]
yeah
um-hum
right
uh other times it could be very casual if you knew you would be at a desk all day and nobody would see you [noise] um
yeah or um-hum what area do you work in
uh well i was i was in a uh private consulting firm so um and uh and uh anyway um right now i- i'm not i'm not there but [laughter] but anyway
um
okay
[laughter]
um and seaso- really same season to season um uh it changes with the weather you know uh wear light clothing i guess if it's hot out but um
it with the
yeah
but then usually in the summer it's cold in the offices because the air conditioner's doing its job so well [noise]
that's
that's true and and i think also that um the women actually have uh uh you have a little bit more variety m- maybe lighter cotton clothing in the summer and woolens in the winter whereas the
oh yeah
the men often have to wear shirt and tie no matter r- right right what time of what time of the year that's right
it
uh-huh just suits and there's not a whole lot of fabric variance there and they can't have a rayon suit [laughter] so
that's that's true so um do they were were there um are you allowed to um be casual like if it was summer were were you allowed to wear sandals and those tha- [noise] not reall-
not really i think i mean it's kind of unwritten but i think we're supposed to wear hose and and shoes you know most of the people do anyway [noise]
right
uh most of the women wear uh m- actually most of the women wear suits more than anything else
oh i see uh-huh
but i'm not in that professional of a position [noise] so i don't i'm not expected to do that
okay and and
and also like the um also the the all the supporting kind of stuff secretaries and clerks and things are they also they have same similar sim- yeah
um-hum
[noise] yes pretty much i'm a secretary [noise] yeah
yeah ours were ours were different i guess it seemed like th- they were much there was much more casual dress although i don't think everybody looked at that you know as a good thing
y- yeah but there's really no written rule i guess they couldn't write that down that might be discrimination or something i don't know i mean i've never been told what to wear or what not to wear
right
that's that's right
it's just you know judging from what everyone else wears is how i determine
yeah
yeah and
you know what i feel a comfortable in you don't wanna stand out too much
that's right
yeah that's true and um hm [noise] well that's it
[noise] well that pretty much covers the subject [laughter] well thanks for calling me
yeah [laughter] i don't know what el- what more we can say about that that's
oh it's been nice talking to you and i guess we just hang up huh okay all right nice talking to you bye-bye
yep that's all good-bye okay bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay uh first um i need to know uh h- how do you feel about uh about sending um an elderly uh family member to a nursing home
well of course it's you know it's it one of the last few things in the world you'd ever want to do you know unless it's just you know really you know f- and for their uh you know for their own good
yes yeah
i'd be very very careful and uh you know checking them out uh our had t- place my mother in a nursing home she had a rather massive stroke about uh
um-hum
uh s- eight months ago i guess
and uh we were i was fortunate in that
i was personally acquainted with the uh people who uh ran the nursing home in our little hometown
yes
so i was very comfortable you know in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it but there's well i had an occasion for my uh mother-in-law who
had fell and needed to be you know could not take care of herself anymore was confined to a nursing home for a while that was really not a very good experience uh
it had to be done in a hurry i mean we didn't have you know like six months to check all of these places out
and it was really not not very good uh
deal we were not really happy with the
yeah
nursing home that we finally had fortunately she only had to stay a few weeks and she was able to to return to her apartment again
but it's really a big uh big decision as to you know when to do it
yeah
you know is there something else we could have done you know in checking out all the places that uh might be available course there's you know there's not one on every corner especially in you know smaller areas smaller towns
um-hum yeah probably the hardest thing in in my family uh my grandmother she had to be put in nursing home and um she had used a walker for for quite sometime probably about six to nine months and um
um-hum
she had a fall and uh finally uh she had uh parkinson's disease and it got so much that she could not take care of her house sh- then she lived in an apartment and um
hm
right
that was even harder actually because it was you know it was just a change of
um-hum um-hum
change of location and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling i mean she tr- she had she had children all across the united states and you know she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children
yes
um-hum
right uh-huh
and um that was pretty heartrending for her i think when she finally came to the realization that you know no i cannot i cannot take care of myself
oh i can imagine
um-hum that's tough that's really tough
yeah i mean for somebody who is you know for most of their life has has uh
not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines and you know facing that situation it it's quite a dilemma i think
um-hum
um-hum
yes
my mother excuse me go ahead
yeah well my uh my uh probably one of the biggest decisions i think that was very strengthened for our family was rather than have one child make that decision
um-hum
than just delegate it i think that they they had a great deal of um all the brothers and sisters got together and they actually had a conference and i mean it was just it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family
that's great
getting down together and doing that and and just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them and you know making that decision and then
that's right i-
um-hum
right yeah
finding a place and everybody had duties to perform you know whether it was just you know giving money or whether it was actually taking part in in a lot of the decision making you know like finding a a proper nursing home
um-hum
um-hum
yep
you were very fortunate
and they i know they and well they had well they had they had seen it coming so so i mean it i mean i i i i hard- i i truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like that for me
um-hum
um-hum
absolutely un- unfortunately at a lot of times it
responsibilities like that seem to fall to you know maybe one child in the whole family you know
yeah yeah well we we yeah
and uh it's usually not a very smooth smooth thing we were uh l- [vocalized-noise] i was lucky too that i only have m- one brother
um-hum
and uh fortunately we agreed you know on exactly you know what we thought should be done
my mother also was very very independent she had her own still had her own little house and still driving her own car at age eighty three
yeah
we were lucky in that in one respect in that after she had her stroke she wasn't really you know really much aware of what was going on
um-hum
that nursing home life would not have been you know anything of her choosing of course she would she would not have been happy there at all but uh as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us
yeah yeah well with my with my grandmother i think it was it was such that uh that she did not have the problem with
she was very well aware and her daughter came and visited her at least her daughter came and visited her and also her uh several grandchildren came and visited her everyday
um-hum um-hum
um-hum
that's great
and i think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest
um i- i- i think it would be it was more of a relief for her
um-hum
sure
and um i mean but she was truly she was truly aware i mean i i di- i don't know how i would how i would deal if if one of my parents came with with alzheimer's or something like that which is which is far more devastating
um-hum
um-hum that'd be tough
yes absolutely
and um
i i th- i think that what one thing that w- that they were really concerned with probably was the fact
it wasn't necessarily you know like the quantity of care but the quality of care that the people that work there were very
um-hum
yes
right
um-hum
were very interested that to make it as close a home environment as possible i i think i think i think you know for myself i i see that as probably the the
um-hum
yes yeah we were fort-
what everything would hinge upon is it how close is it to a home environment that's the that's probably the major question
oh yes
that's right um-hum
yeah i think a great strides are being made nowadays in in caring for the elderly you know in several in a whole lot of areas -se people are of course population is getting older you know
yeah
yeah
yeah you know it's it's interesting that that a lot of the population in the united states is changing because
you know uh now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time
um-hum
um i- matter of fact in the united states we used to have extended families it wasn't but i guess as we become more industrialized and more you know less in a rural situation
um-hum -t's right
yes
we we don't we we we choose not to deal with the extended family because we feel it's kind of cumbersome when in reality it makes things much much easier
um-hum um-hum
that's right
sure absolutely and people are families are scattered so much nowadays
uh
yeah yeah i i i think that perhaps perhaps the extended family
you know that that it may be one of the solutions to a lot of things e- e- even child care you know i mean of course there there comes other issues you know whether or not
yes
any of the grandparents would we feel they're gonna be a good [laughter] they're gonna be a good caretaker for our children but i mean they raised us after all
yeah yeah just because they're grandparents jus- yeah just because they're grandparents that doesn't automatically make them a good child carer
yeah but uh i'm i i think that you know i mean we always uh i mean i've i've had a a lot of good experiences with uh with many many people
especially where they've had uh extended family and i and an- i i kind of see that that you know perhaps
you know we may need to like get close to the family environment and and get down to the values of you know i mean uh it's
um-hum
money seems to be too big of an issue wi- with with with with with what's going on today and i i think i think that we may not you know that may be
oh yeah sure realistically it is yes
you know perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problems i mean [noise] i mean we may not we may not have as [noise] high a standard of living but
um-hum
that would certainly help yeah
um-hum
the qua- but actually have a truer standard of living
right that's just a matter of defining priorities i guess or some priorities anyway
yeah yeah
yeah
i think your right
[noise]
okay well
i guess that was it [laughter]
okay was good talking to you yeah take care bye-bye
[noise]
okay all right hey bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
[noise]
alrighty uh i guess our topic today is air pollution and we are to just discuss what substances do you think contribute most to air pollution
as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us
